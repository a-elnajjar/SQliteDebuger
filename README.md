`SQLiteDebuger` is an experimental Swift package designed to help developers debug and manage SQLite databases directly within their iOS applications. By leveraging the SQLite3 C API, this package provides a straightforward way to open, switch, and execute SQL statements on SQLite databases. It benefits developers who need to inspect database contents, execute arbitrary queries, and view results in a structured format without leaving their app.

## Features

- Execute SQL statements and display results.

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- Swift 5.5+

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                NavigationLink(destination: SQLiteDebugView()) {
                    Text("Open SQLite Debug View")
                        .padding()
                        .background(Color.blue)
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                        .cornerRadius(8)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Main Menu")
        }
    }
